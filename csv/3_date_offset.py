# Challenge:

# Date offset (bonus) - The start_date field contains data in a variety of
# formats. These may include e.g., "June 23, 1912" or "5/11/1930" (month, day,
# year). But not all values are valid dates. Invalid dates may include e.g.,
# "June 2018", "3/06" (incomplete dates) or even arbitrary natural language.
# Add a start_date_description field adjacent to the start_date column to
# filter invalid date values into. Normalize all valid date values in
# start_date to ISO 8601 (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD).
